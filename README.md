# Rotterdam Time Machine

An interactive SvelteKit app for exploring, comparing, and studying georeferenced historical maps of Rotterdam over time. Historical map layers are loaded through Allmaps annotations and displayed on top of a modern Protomaps/MapLibre basemap.

_This project was initially developed as a student project in collaboration between Delft University of Technology Library, Rotterdam City Archive and MBO Techniek College Rotterdam._

## Features

- Explore historical maps with a vertical time slider
- Select multiple maps from the same year in the layers panel
- Compare two map views side by side or stacked on smaller screens
- Adjust opacity, map orientation, and map focus per map pane
- Filter by favorites and maps that overlap the current map view
- Search for locations with Nominatim, bounded to the map collection area
- Share the current map view through the URL
- Mobile layout with the same map and layer controls

## Local Development

### Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 18 or higher
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)

### Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/allmaps/rotterdam-tijdmachine.git
cd rotterdam-tijdmachine
pnpm install
```

### Run

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

Then open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

### Check And Build

```bash
pnpm run check
pnpm run build
```

For deployment under a subpath, set the SvelteKit base path with `BASE_PATH`:

```bash
BASE_PATH=/rotterdam-tijdmachine npm run build
```

## Reusing the app with different content

The app is structured so the most important content lives outside the components. To reuse it for another city, region, or map collection, you mainly need to edit these two files:

- `config.yml`: app settings, text, metadata, and UI labels
- `collection.yml`: historical map records and Allmaps annotation URLs

The YAML files are imported in `src/routes/+page.ts` and `src/routes/+layout.ts` through `@modyfi/vite-plugin-yaml`. If you extend the YAML structure, also update the shared types in `src/lib/types.ts`.

### `config.yml`

Important sections:

- `site`: name, URL, description, and locale for metadata
- `theme.color`: Tailwind palette name, hex value, or RGB value used for the primary UI color
- `theme.shade`: main shade for the primary UI color; supported values are `400`, `500`, `600`, `700`, and `800`
- `map.defaultYear`: the year the app opens with by default
- `map.initialView`: default map view with `center`, `zoom`, and `bearing`
- `map.keyboard`: panning distance for keyboard map movement
- `basemap.protomapsApiKey`: API key used for Protomaps hosted basemap tiles
- `slider.scaleInterval`: year scale interval
- `header`, `about`, `share`, `search`, `layers`, `controls`, `mapWarnings`: visible labels and modal text

For a new use case, usually start with:

1. Update `site.name`, `site.url`, and `site.description`.
2. Set `map.defaultYear` to a year that exists in your collection.
3. Set `map.initialView.center` to `[longitude, latitude]` for your area.
4. Set `theme.color` and `theme.shade` for the primary UI color, for example `color: blue` and `shade: 700`. The app derives five semantic brand shades from that value: soft, muted, secondary, main, and hover. You can also write the shade in `theme.color`, such as `blue-700`, if `theme.shade` is omitted. Custom colors are supported too, for example `color: "#006d2c"` or `color: rgb(0, 109, 44)`. Quote hex values in YAML. For custom colors, the provided color is always used as `brand-main`, so `theme.shade` only applies to Tailwind palette names.
5. Request your own free Protomaps API key at [protomaps.com/api](https://protomaps.com/api) and set it as `basemap.protomapsApiKey`.
6. Rewrite or translate the text under `about`, `search`, `layers`, and `controls`.
7. Check `search.countryCodes` if the app is used outside the Netherlands.

### `collection.yml`

Each map in the collection has this shape:

```yaml
- label: Short title for the UI
  title: Full title or description
  year: 1897
  institution: Institution name
  url: https://example.org/item
  iiif:
    url: https://example.org/iiif/manifest.json
    type: manifest
  annotation: https://annotations.allmaps.org/manifests/example
```

Required fields:

- `label`: short name used in the slider, layer panel, and search results
- `title`: full title
- `year`: year used for sorting on the slider
- `institution`: collection holder or institution
- `url`: public item page
- `annotation`: Allmaps annotation URL

Optional fields:

- `iiif.url`: IIIF Image API `info.json` or IIIF Presentation manifest
- `iiif.type`: `image` or `manifest`

Multiple maps can share the same year. The app will show previous/next buttons and a position indicator, for example `1/3`.

### Allmaps Annotations

The app expects each map to have a valid Allmaps annotation. The helper in `src/lib/warped-map-list.ts` fetches these annotations, builds a `WarpedMapList`, and uses that list for:

- displaying historical map layers
- the "in view" filter
- map bounds and visibility checks
- linking Allmaps map IDs back to records in `collection.yml`

### Basemap and search bounds

The basemap uses Protomaps in `src/lib/basemap.ts`, with the API key configured through `basemap.protomapsApiKey` in `config.yml`. Developers reusing this app should request their own free Protomaps API key at [protomaps.com/api](https://protomaps.com/api). Protomaps keys can be restricted by domain, so configure the allowed origins for your deployment as needed.

The Nominatim search bounds are derived from the bounds of the Allmaps layer. For a new collection, check that the combined annotations cover the area you want users to search.

## Project Structure

- `config.yml`: app settings, text, and metadata
- `collection.yml`: map collection
- `src/routes/+page.ts`: loads config and collection for the main page
- `src/routes/+layout.ts`: loads config for metadata
- `src/lib/components`: Svelte components for the map, layers, header, modals, and slider
- `src/lib/app-state.svelte.ts`: shared UI state, favorites, and map pane state
- `src/lib/services/geocoder.svelte.ts`: Nominatim search service
- `src/lib/warped-map-list.ts`: Allmaps annotation and warped map helper
- `src/lib/types.ts`: shared TypeScript types for config, collection, and UI events

## Credits And Attribution

- Historical map records link to their source institutions through `institution` and `url` in `collection.yml`.
- Georeferencing and map warping are handled through [Allmaps](https://allmaps.org/).
- The modern basemap uses [Protomaps](https://protomaps.com/) and data from [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/).
- Location search uses [Nominatim](https://nominatim.org/); when reusing the app, follow the [Nominatim Usage Policy](https://operations.osmfoundation.org/policies/nominatim/).

# Rotterdam Time Machine

An interactive SvelteKit app for exploring, comparing, and studying georeferenced historical maps of Rotterdam over time. Historical map layers are loaded through Allmaps annotations and displayed on top of a modern Protomaps/MapLibre basemap.

_This project was initially developed as a student project in collaboration between Delft University of Technology Library, Rotterdam City Archive and MBO Techniek College Rotterdam._

## Features

- Explore historical maps with a vertical time slider
- Select multiple maps from the same year in the layers panel
- Compare two map views side by side or stacked on smaller screens
- Adjust opacity, map orientation, and map focus per map pane
- Filter by favorites and maps that overlap the current map view
- Search for locations with Nominatim, bounded to the map collection area
- Share the current map view through the URL
- Mobile layout with the same map and layer controls

## Local development

### Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 18 or higher
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)

### Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/allmaps/rotterdam-tijdmachine.git
cd rotterdam-tijdmachine
pnpm install
```

### Run

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

Then open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

### Check And build

```bash
pnpm run check
pnpm run build
```

For deployment under a subpath, set the SvelteKit base path with `BASE_PATH`:

```bash
BASE_PATH=/rotterdam-tijdmachine pnpm run build
```

To run or build with alternate content files, set `CONFIG`:

```bash
CONFIG=config-gouda.yml pnpm run dev
CONFIG=content/config-gouda.yml pnpm run build
```

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

This repository is configured for GitHub Pages through [`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`](.github/workflows/deploy.yml). The workflow builds the static SvelteKit site and deploys the generated `build/` directory with GitHub's official Pages actions.

To enable deployment:

1. In GitHub, open **Settings > Pages** for the repository.
2. Set **Build and deployment > Source** to **GitHub Actions**.
3. Push to the `main` branch, or run **Deploy to GitHub Pages** manually from the **Actions** tab.

The workflow resolves `BASE_PATH` before building. By default, it uses the repository name, which is correct for a GitHub Pages project site, such as:

```text
https://allmaps.github.io/rotterdam-tijdmachine/
https://pages.allmaps.org/rotterdam-tijdmachine/
```

`BASE_PATH` must match the subpath where the app is served. The workflow automatically uses an empty base path when:

- the repository is an organization/user Pages repository, such as `allmaps.github.io`
- the repository contains `static/CNAME`, which indicates a root custom-domain deployment

You can also override this behavior without editing the workflow:

- Set a repository variable named `PAGES_BASE_PATH` to a path such as `/rotterdam-tijdmachine`
- Set `PAGES_BASE_PATH` to `/` for a root-domain deployment
- Use the manual **Deploy to GitHub Pages** workflow input `base_path` for one-off deployments

The manual workflow input and repository variable both accept values with or without a leading slash. The workflow normalizes `rotterdam-tijdmachine` to `/rotterdam-tijdmachine`.

Before deploying a reused version of the app, update:

- `site.url` in `config.yml` to the final public URL, including the trailing slash
- `basemap.protomapsApiKey` to your own key, and allow the GitHub Pages origin in the Protomaps dashboard
- `CONFIG` as a repository variable, or the manual workflow input `config`, if you want to deploy an alternate config file

For example:

| Deployment target                                  | `PAGES_BASE_PATH`                 |
| -------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `https://allmaps.github.io/rotterdam-tijdmachine/` | `/rotterdam-tijdmachine` or unset |
| `https://pages.allmaps.org/rotterdam-tijdmachine/` | `/rotterdam-tijdmachine` or unset |
| `https://tijdmachine.example.org/`                 | `/`                               |

To deploy an alternate configuration, set the repository variable `CONFIG` to a file such as `content/config-gouda.yml`, or fill in the `config` input when manually running the workflow.

SvelteKit is configured with `@sveltejs/adapter-static` and `fallback: '404.html'`, so direct links with query parameters keep working on GitHub Pages.

## Reusing the app with different content

The app is structured so the most important content lives outside the components. To reuse it for another city, region, or map collection, you mainly need to edit these two files:

- `config.yml`: app settings, text, metadata, and UI labels
- `collection.yml`: historical map records and Georeference Annotation URLs or local annotation paths

The YAML files are loaded through `src/lib/content.ts` and `@modyfi/vite-plugin-yaml`. If you extend the YAML structure, also update the shared types in `src/lib/types.ts`.

By default, the app uses `config.yml`, which points to `collection.yml`. To keep multiple configurations in one repository, add alternate YAML files either in the project root or in a `content/` folder and select the configuration file with `CONFIG`:

```bash
CONFIG=config-gouda.yml pnpm run dev
CONFIG=content/config-gouda.yml pnpm run build
```

`CONFIG` selects the app configuration file. If it is omitted, the app falls back to `config.yml`. The selected config file then points to the collection with its top-level `collection` field. Bare collection filenames are resolved relative to the config file, so `content/config-gouda.yml` can use `collection: collection-gouda.yml`.

### `config.yml`

Important sections:

- `collection`: YAML file with map records; bare filenames are resolved relative to the config file
- `site`: name, URL, description, and locale for metadata
- `theme.color`: hex or RGB value used for the primary UI color
- `theme.fonts`: optional custom font files and semantic font roles
- `map.defaultYear`: the year the app opens with by default
- `map.initialView`: default map view with `center`, `zoom`, and `bearing`
- `map.keyboard`: panning distance for keyboard map movement
- `basemap.protomapsApiKey`: API key used for Protomaps hosted basemap tiles
- `slider.scaleInterval`: year scale interval
- `tour.enabled`: set to `false` to disable the one-time guided tour
- `header`, `about`, `share`, `search`, `layers`, `controls`, `mapWarnings`: visible labels and modal text

For a new use case, usually start with:

1. Update `site.name`, `site.url`, and `site.description`.
2. Set `map.defaultYear` to a year that exists in your collection.
3. Set `map.initialView.center` to `[longitude, latitude]` for your area.
4. Set `theme.color` for the primary UI color, for example `color: "#006d2c"` or `color: rgb(0, 109, 44)`. Quote hex values in YAML. The app derives five semantic brand colors from that value: soft, muted, secondary, main, and hover.
5. Request your own free Protomaps API key at [protomaps.com/api](https://protomaps.com/api) and set it as `basemap.protomapsApiKey`.
6. Rewrite or translate the text under `tour`, `about`, `search`, `layers`, and `controls`.
7. Check `search.countryCodes` if the app is used outside the Netherlands.

### Custom fonts

Noto Sans is bundled with the app and is always used as the fallback font. To use a custom font, place the font files in `static/fonts` and define them under `theme.fonts` in `config.yml`. Font paths are resolved through SvelteKit's base path, so both `fonts/ExampleSans-Regular.woff2` and `/fonts/ExampleSans-Regular.woff2` work when deploying under a subpath. Absolute font URLs, such as CDN-hosted `https://...` URLs, can also be used.

```yaml
theme:
  fonts:
    families:
      - name: Example Sans
        faces:
          - weight: 400
            style: normal
            files:
              - fonts/ExampleSans-Regular.woff2
          - weight: 700
            style: normal
            files:
              - fonts/ExampleSans-Bold.woff2
    roles:
      body: Noto Sans
      accent: Example Sans
      heading: Example Sans
      display: Example Sans
```

Font roles map to the app's internal Tailwind font classes:

- `body`: default page text
- `accent`: compact UI elements such as the header and slider
- `heading`: titles, badges, and shortcut key labels
- `display`: reserved for larger display text

Each role can be a single family name or a list, for example `heading: [Example Heading, Example Sans]`. The app automatically appends `Noto Sans, ui-sans-serif, system-ui, sans-serif` as fallback fonts. If `theme.fonts` is omitted, all roles use Noto Sans.

### Favicon

The favicon is served from `static/favicon.svg`. To reuse the app with another brand, replace that file with your own SVG favicon. The layout references it through SvelteKit's base path, so it also works when the app is deployed under a subpath.

### `collection.yml`

Each map in the collection has this shape:

```yaml
- label: Short title for the UI
  title: Full title or description
  year: 1897
  institution: Institution name
  url: https://example.org/item
  iiif:
    url: https://example.org/iiif/manifest.json
    type: manifest
  annotation: https://annotations.allmaps.org/manifests/example
```

Required fields:

- `label`: short name used in the slider, layer panel, and search results
- `title`: full title
- `year`: year used for sorting on the slider; this can be a single year such as `1897` or an inclusive range such as `1811/1832`
- `institution`: collection holder or institution
- `url`: public item page
- `annotation`: Georeference Annotation URL, or a path to a bundled annotation file in `static/`

Optional fields:

- `iiif.url`: IIIF Image API `info.json` or IIIF Presentation manifest
- `iiif.type`: `image` or `manifest`

Multiple maps can share the same year. The app will show previous/next buttons and a position indicator, for example `1/3`. Maps with a year range appear for every year in that range.

### Georeference Annotations

The app expects each map to have valid Georeference Annotations. During development and production builds, `scripts/generate-annotations.ts` reads the configured collection, fetches or reads every annotation, parses the annotations with Allmaps, and writes a generated JSON asset to `src/lib/generated/maps.json`. The app then loads that local generated asset and builds a `WarpedMapList` from it for:

- displaying historical map layers
- the "in view" filter
- map bounds and visibility checks
- linking Georeference Annotations IDs back to records in `collection.yml`

Annotations can be referenced as full external URLs:

```yaml
annotation: https://annotations.allmaps.org/manifests/example
```

They can also be bundled with the app by placing JSON files in `static/annotations` and using the served path in `collection.yml`. Files in `static` are served from the site root, so omit the `static/` prefix:

```yaml
annotation: annotations/rotterdam-1897.json
```

Relative annotation paths are resolved with the SvelteKit base path, so they continue to work when the app is deployed under a subpath such as `/rotterdam-tijdmachine`. Links generated for Allmaps Viewer and copied XYZ tile URLs use the full public URL for bundled annotations, for example `https://example.org/time-machine/annotations/rotterdam-1897.json`.

Remote annotations are cached in `.cache/annotations` after a successful fetch, so later builds can fall back to cached data if a remote annotation service is temporarily unavailable. The generated JSON and cache directory are ignored by Git. To refresh the generated annotation asset manually, run:

```bash
npm run generate:annotations
```

### Basemap and search bounds

The basemap uses Protomaps in `src/lib/basemap.ts`, with the API key configured through `basemap.protomapsApiKey` in `config.yml`. Developers reusing this app should request their own free Protomaps API key at [protomaps.com/api](https://protomaps.com/api). Protomaps keys can be restricted by domain, so configure the allowed origins for your deployment as needed.

The Nominatim search bounds are derived from the bounds of the Allmaps layer. For a new collection, check that the combined annotations cover the area you want users to search.

### Constructing URLs

The app opens with the default map and view from `config.yml` when no query parameters are provided:

```text
https://example.org/time-machine/
```

You can link to a year with the `year` parameter. This parameter only accepts a numeric year and selects the first map in `collection.yml` for that year:

```text
https://example.org/time-machine/?year=1897
```

You can link to a specific map with the `map` parameter. This parameter accepts an annotation value that exists in `collection.yml`:

```text
https://example.org/time-machine/?map=https%3A%2F%2Fannotations.allmaps.org%2Fmanifests%2Fexample
```

For bundled annotations, use the same relative value as `collection.yml`:

```text
https://example.org/time-machine/?map=annotations%2Frotterdam-1897.json
```

If `year` and `map` are both present, `map` takes preference. To link to a specific view, add `lat`, `lng`, and optionally `zoom` and `bearing`:

```text
https://example.org/time-machine/?lat=51.92146&lng=4.48488&zoom=14.00&map=https%3A%2F%2Fannotations.allmaps.org%2Fmanifests%2Fexample
```

The sharing modal keeps the default link simple and only includes view parameters when the current-view option is selected.
